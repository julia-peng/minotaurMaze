# Minotaur's Maze

A simple 3-portion game I made with my partner Maya Peski for the ICS3U course. 

The graphics are based on HSA's Console class, as is compatible with the Ready to Program compiler used in the development of this project.

My contribution to this project was mostly the development of the graphics. The mmages were drawn on PixlArt, with the animation portion being processed using HSA Console and other appropriate structures. Additionally, I also developed the high score system.

Game.java is the driver class.
